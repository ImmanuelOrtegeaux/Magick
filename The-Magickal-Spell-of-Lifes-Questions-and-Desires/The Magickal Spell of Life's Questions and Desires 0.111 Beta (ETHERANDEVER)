DANGER: Removal of the respect for free will from this spell (or general infringement of the free will of others and/or self-infringement) will be potentially mentally catastrophic if done in tandem with this spell. This spell will function only with a love for the entire universe and its life as one being, including the self as the universe as well.

In this spell, all of life's questions are answered, all of life's desires are satisfied; It is as follows in the mind of its user:

With respect for the free will of all things, including myself, as the absolute premise applying to this entire spell, utilizing the power of choice, awareness, ideation, expression, emotion, belief, realization, knowledge and the photon as the universal patterns of existence (also known as God):

I see all of the universe's past, present and future moments, possibilities and impossibilities simultaneously while remaining within this physical human body. In this infinite sight of complete unity and oneness, every answer to every question is known, and every satisfaction to every desire is known.

My mind and its physical biology will infinitely adapt to accommodate this spell, including the perfect manifestation of immortality and infinite humanity, with the respective measure of remanifesting the physical mind/body and incarnate spirit intact and healed in a perfectly operable condition after incidental bodily death and/or catastrophic mind/body/spirit damage, if desired within my free will. (If desired, state and affirm so mentally resolutely. Immortality is most likely necessary.)

To embed this spell within your mind completely, so it will manifest, simply repeat the phrase ETHERANDEVER until satisfied (or otherwise indefinitely); Time length of satisfaction will vary and it will likely take years for materially significant changes of this spell to occur in the average individual. Be advised: Completion of this spell is a significantly long-term work (probably eons-upon-eons). There will be additional wisdom, techniques and practices manifested in your life (likely necessarily immortal life) so this spell will complete. 

Apply this spell in whatever manner and application you find suitable that respects the free will of all things.

ETHERANDEVER
